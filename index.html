                1998, Apple was struggling—its product line was bloated, inventory was piling up, and operational inefficiencies were draining the company. That same year, Steve Jobs made a critical HR move: he hired Tim Cook as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations.
                <br />
                Cook wasn’t a flashy designer or visionary product leader—he was a logistics and operations expert. But that’s exactly what Apple needed. He came from Compaq and deeply understood supply chain management and scalable production models.

            <motion.div
                initial="hidden"
                whileInView="visible"
                viewport={{ once: true }}
                variants={fadeInUp}
                custom={0.3}
                class="case-main__text">
                Within months of joining, Cook overhauled Apple’s supply chain, implementing a lean, just-in-time inventory system, closing underperforming factories, and reducing the number of suppliers. He shifted Apple from a company trying to do everything to one that relied on strategic outsourcing and operational excellence.
                <ul>
                    <li>Inventory turnover improved dramatically</li>
                    <li>Production costs were cut without sacrificing quality</li>
                    <li>Product delivery became faster and more reliable</li>
                    <li>The company became scalable without ballooning overhead</li>
                </ul>
                These operational improvements freed up resources for Apple to focus on design, innovation, and customer experience—what the world knows it for today.
