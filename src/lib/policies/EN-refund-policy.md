## Purpose of the Policy
This Refund Policy outlines the principles and procedures under which Neonhire LTD (“we,” “us,” or “our”) considers refund requests related to HR services and solutions purchased via our website or through direct engagement. Due to the strategic nature and resource commitment involved in delivering our services, all purchases are considered final and non-refundable, except in specific cases outlined below.

## General Policy on Refunds
Neon HR Group operates on a strict no-refund basis for services delivered or initiated. By confirming any transaction or service engagement with Neonhire LTD, you acknowledge and accept that:

- All services are tailored, time-bound, and require resource allocation in advance
- Your purchase is made with a clear understanding of the service scope, pricing, and deliverables
- Refunds will not be issued for dissatisfaction with outcomes if the agreed scope of service has been fulfilled

We strongly advise all prospective clients to fully review service descriptions, terms of engagement, and timelines before confirming a transaction.

## Exceptional Conditions for Refund Consideration
Refunds may be considered on an exceptional basis and only under the following circumstances:

- **Duplicate or Accidental Payments:** If multiple identical payments are received due to a processing error or customer oversight
- **Incorrect Charges:** If a client is charged an amount inconsistent with the final confirmed quotation or invoice due to a technical or administrative error
- **Services Not Rendered:** If a paid service is not initiated or delivered as outlined in the agreed scope of work, the failure is solely attributable to Neonhire LTD.
- **Billing Error:** If services are added to your invoice in error and were neither requested nor used, a full correction and refund will be issued without delay
- **Non-Completion Due to Neonhire LTD Fault:** If the service cannot be delivered in full due to internal limitations or cancellation from our side

Refunds will not be considered for subjective dissatisfaction, changes in business direction, or project cancellations initiated by the client after the commencement of work.

## Refund Request Procedure
If your case qualifies under the conditions above, you may submit a formal refund request by contacting us at info@neonhrgroup.com. Your request must include:

- Full Name and Company Name
- Email Address used during the transaction
- Invoice Number or Transaction ID
- Date of Payment
- Description of the issue and reason for the refund request
- Supporting documentation, if applicable

Requests should be submitted within 10 business days of the original payment date.

## Review and Decision Timeline
Once a refund request is received, our billing and compliance team will conduct a detailed case review. All decisions are made based on:

- The nature of the issue
- The accuracy of supporting documentation
- Compliance with the terms of service
- Evidence of service delivery or non-performance

You will receive a written response within 7 business days of submission. If approved, refunds will be processed to the original method of payment within an additional 7–10 business days. Decisions made by Neonhire LTD regarding refund requests are considered final.
